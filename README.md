AI Code Reviewer
AI Code Reviewer is a web application that uses an AI model to review code. It highlights issues and provides suggestions in clear, concise bullet points. Users can paste their code into a text area, and the app will give them feedback on how to improve it.

Features

Code Review: Paste your code into a text area, and the app sends it to the backend for analysis.

Review Feedback: The backend processes the code and sends back a list of suggestions for improvement.

Clean UI: User-friendly interface with modern design.

Error Handling: Displays error messages if the review fails.


Tech Stack

React: For building the user interface.

Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend.

CSS: Custom styling for the app.

Backend:
Node.js with Express: For handling backend requests.

AI API (Google Gemini): For code analysis and review.
